Dragon Real Estate - Price Predictor
Description
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict housing prices for Dragon Real Estate using a variety of regression techniques. The goal was to create a robust and accurate predictor to assist in real estate investment decisions.

Project Steps:
Data Loading and Exploration:

Imported the dataset using Pandas and performed an initial exploration to understand the data structure.
Analyzed key attributes and their distributions using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values using different strategies like median imputation to ensure data completeness.
Performed train-test splitting using both random and stratified methods to ensure balanced datasets.

Feature Engineering:

Created new features and analyzed their correlations with the target variable to enhance model performance.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize relationships between features and the target variable.
Data Transformation:

Built a preprocessing pipeline with Scikit-learn to streamline transformations such as imputation and scaling.
Applied standardization to ensure features have similar scales, improving model performance.

Model Training:

Experimented with multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
Selected Random Forest Regressor as the final model based on its superior performance during training.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluated models using cross-validation to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting.
Calculated key metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify prediction accuracy.

Model Deployment:

Saved the trained model using Joblib for future use and easy deployment.
Tested the final model on a separate test set to evaluate its performance in a real-world scenario.

Key Outcomes:

Accurate Predictions: The final model, Random Forest Regressor, achieved a low RMSE, indicating high prediction accuracy.
Comprehensive Pipeline: Developed a robust data preprocessing and training pipeline, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.
Insightful Visualizations: Created meaningful visualizations to understand data distributions and feature relationships, aiding in better model insights.

Technologies Used:

Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and model building.
Pandas & NumPy: For efficient data handling and numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and preprocessing utilities.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Joblib: For model serialization.

Usage:

To run the project, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Load the dataset, preprocess it using the provided pipeline, train the model, and evaluate its performance using the test data.

Future Work:
Hyperparameter Tuning: Further optimize model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters.
Feature Selection: Explore additional features or combinations to improve model accuracy.
Deployment: Implement the model in a web application for real-time price prediction.
